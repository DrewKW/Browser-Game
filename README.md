A Milestone 1 interactive game
                         Snakes & Ladders
 I grew up in Kenya, East Africa playing what I didn't know at that time was called a board game. I spent numerous amounts of useless times rolling a dice and wondering why I was so much better than my peers at dice throwing - although 'Lady Luck' always seems to dump me when we reach Las Vegas and reunites back in Los Angeles. So 'Snakes & Ladders' was a board game that I was excited to create as a browser game.
